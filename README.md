A project that I made in my 1st semester of my 2nd year in the University.

This was pretty rough but because this project is one of the reasons why I got a good reputation in my department. Merely because I did this project alone, well I didn't know most people in my class at that time.

I'm still thankful for this project, it proves me that I can do anything and easily adapt when it comes to different platforms.
